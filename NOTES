ISSUES


1. Fix line 23 in app/views/devise/shared/_links.html.erb
 -> right now only allows facebook

2. Work on log in form: not centered

FOR SEARCHING WITH DUE DATE:
  1. search dates are off by 1 day! so search results don't return edge cases
  3.Search controller and routes. Is this restful?

  4. Understand the data: part:
  http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/action_controller_overview.html#outside-the-scope-of-strong-parameters
  def project_params
    params.require(:project).permit(:name, :description, :team_id, :user_id, data: params[:project][:data].try(:keys))
  end

  5.Can I use f.select?

-----

1. Implement search function in home page
- search for project by name
- search for task by name
- search by team (needs to be a team that the user's in )
- search by due date: past due, due today, due in a week, due in 2 weeks...
