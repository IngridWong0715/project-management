ISSUES


1. Fix line 23 in app/views/devise/shared/_links.html.erb
 -> right now only allows facebook

2. Work on log in form: not centered

3.Search controller and routes. Is this restful?

1. Implement search function in home page
- search for project by name
- search for task by name
- search by team (needs to be a team that the user's in )
- search by due date: past due, due today, due in a week, due in 2 weeks...
