Functionalities to build:


- Share tasks and projects with other users
  (right now can only do so through teams)

- Add scroll to list group in home view

- override bootstrap container

- do something to the flash messages in layouts/application

- Use JS to build complete checkbox for projects and tasks AND add a "completed" page to show these AND remove these completed projects/tasks from show pages

ISSUES

1. NESTED FORM ISSUES:
  a) Can't create project without creating an associated task.
  b) Can't create a team (even by creating an associated project -> due to a)?  )
  error from rake db:reset ActiveRecord::RecordNotSaved: You cannot call create unless the parent is saved


2. Fix line 23 in app/views/devise/shared/_links.html.erb
 -> right now only allows facebook

3.FOR SEARCHING WITH DUE DATE:
  1. search dates are off by 1 day! so search results don't return edge cases
  3.Search controller and routes. Is this restful?

  4. Understand the data: part:
  http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/action_controller_overview.html#outside-the-scope-of-strong-parameters
  def project_params
    params.require(:project).permit(:name, :description, :team_id, :user_id, data: params[:project][:data].try(:keys))
  end

  5.Can I use f.select?

4. Nav bar: teams
  - if a user has more than x teams, should turn into a drop down

5. Change navbar color to blue: customize https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/theming/

Things to review at end of project:


1..Project.group_projects: WHY NESTED ARRAY? (Project.rb)

2. Layouts for navigation:
- Different layouts:https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/wiki/How-To:-Create-custom-layouts
  - have a separate layout for welcome controller: ASK!! AM I LOADING BOOTSTRAP TWICE?!?!?
