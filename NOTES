Functionalities to build:

- Share tasks and projects with other users
  (right now can only do so through teams)

- Add scroll to list group in home view
-----

ISSUES

1. Can't create project without creating an associated task. Same with team without project
-> accepts_nested_attributes_for issue!!

1. Fix line 23 in app/views/devise/shared/_links.html.erb
 -> right now only allows facebook

2. Work on log in form: not centered

3.FOR SEARCHING WITH DUE DATE:
  1. search dates are off by 1 day! so search results don't return edge cases
  3.Search controller and routes. Is this restful?

  4. Understand the data: part:
  http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/action_controller_overview.html#outside-the-scope-of-strong-parameters
  def project_params
    params.require(:project).permit(:name, :description, :team_id, :user_id, data: params[:project][:data].try(:keys))
  end

  5.Can I use f.select?

Things to review at end of project:


1..Project.group_projects: WHY NESTED ARRAY? (Project.rb)

2. Compare with this:
