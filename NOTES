Project review issues(01/05/2018)
1. Readme: https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2
2. Create new team(working, but not satisfactory; see Issue 1)
3. devise log in/registration (done, see bottom page)
------

Functionalities to build:


- Share tasks and projects with other users
  (right now can only do so through teams)

- Add scroll to list group in home view

- override bootstrap container

- do something to the flash messages in layouts/application

- Use JS to build complete checkbox for projects and tasks AND add a "completed" page to show these AND remove these completed projects/tasks from show pages
-----

ISSUES

1. TALK TO KENLYN: new and update for team:
  - how to associate it directly with current_user so that in the form, only shows other users?
    - right now, in controller:
      - update: @team.users<<current_user  (line 28 in team_controller; CHANGEEE!!!???)

. LOOK AT NESTED ROUTE FOR TEAM/PROJECT:
  - all the crud actions

. NESTED FORM ISSUES:
  a) Can't create project without creating an associated task.
  b) Can't create a team (even by creating an associated project -> due to a)?  )
  error from rake db:reset ActiveRecord::RecordNotSaved: You cannot call create unless the parent is saved


2. Fix line 23 in app/views/devise/shared/_links.html.erb
 -> right now only allows facebook

3.FOR SEARCHING WITH DUE DATE:
  1. search dates are off by 1 day! so search results don't return edge cases: due_today project is "PAST DUE" when it shouldn't be
  3.Search controller and routes. Is this restful?

  4. Understand the data: part:
  http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/action_controller_overview.html#outside-the-scope-of-strong-parameters
  def project_params
    params.require(:project).permit(:name, :description, :team_id, :user_id, data: params[:project][:data].try(:keys))
  end

  5.Can I use f.select?

4. Nav bar: teams
  - if a user has more than x teams, should turn into a drop down

5. Change navbar color to blue: customize https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/theming/

-----

Things to review/refactor at end of project:


1..Project.group_projects: WHY NESTED ARRAY? (Project.rb)

2. Layouts for navigation:
- Different layouts:https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/wiki/How-To:-Create-custom-layouts
  - have a separate layout for welcome controller: ASK!! AM I LOADING BOOTSTRAP TWICE?!?!?


3. Compare with this:
https://learn.co/tracks/full-stack-web-development-v5/rails/crud-with-rails/resource-generator-routes

4. New/Edit forms:
  4.1 using .persisted?
    -> too much logic in views?
  4.2 styling with form_center for now
    -> not bootstrapped

5. users/projects_table: team_projects?(projects) helper:
  -> is this the best way to do it?

FIXED FB LOGIN :
in views/devise/share/_links.html
  REPLACE:

    <%- if devise_mapping.omniauthable? %>
      <%- resource_class.omniauth_providers.each do |provider| %>
        <%= link_to "Log in with #{OmniAuth::Utils.camelize(provider)}", user_facebook_omniauth_authorize_path(resource_name, provider) %><br />
      <% end -%>
    <% end -%>

  WITH:
    <%= link_to "Sign in with Facebook", user_facebook_omniauth_authorize_path %>
